# Project Organization Summary

This document summarizes the organizational changes made to improve the structure and maintainability of the bookstore-website project.

## Directory Structure Improvements

### Top-Level Organization

- Created comprehensive documentation in README.md explaining the overall project structure
- Improved organization of core directories (src, scripts, database, docs, public)

### Source Code Organization

- Organized `src/lib` into logical subdirectories:
  - `database/` - Database connection and utilities
  - `services/` - Business logic services
  - `utils/` - Utility functions
- Created index.ts files for better import patterns
- Added detailed README.md file explaining the src directory structure
- Removed empty data directory after moving CSV files to database/data

### Scripts Organization

- Organized scripts into purpose-based directories:
  - `database/` - Database-related scripts
  - `images/` - Image and asset management scripts
  - `build/` - Build and deployment scripts
  - `legacy/` - Legacy scripts that are kept for reference
- Removed empty utils directory
- Updated documentation to reflect new organization
- Added guidelines for script naming and organization

### Database Organization

- Created proper directory structure for database assets
- Added CSV data files to database/data directory for better organization
- Updated scripts to reference the new data locations

### Public Assets Organization

- Organized into logical directories:
  - `images/` - Website images 
  - `default/` - Default placeholder images
  - `favicons/` - Browser favicon files (with placeholder to ensure directory is tracked)
- Added documentation explaining the organization

## Documentation Improvements

- Documented directory structures in README files
- Added clear instructions for adding new scripts
- Created consistent naming conventions
- Added file organization guidelines
- Improved documentation for project setup and usage

## Maintenance Benefits

1. **Improved Discoverability**: Files are now easier to locate due to logical organization
2. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Related functionality is grouped together
3. **Simplified Imports**: Index files make importing cleaner and more maintainable
4. **Clear Conventions**: Established naming and organization conventions for future development
5. **Better Documentation**: Comprehensive README files explain the project structure

## Next Steps

1. Consider implementing automatic code formatting and linting
2. Create a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
3. Implement consistent error handling patterns across the codebase
4. Improve test coverage across components and utilities
